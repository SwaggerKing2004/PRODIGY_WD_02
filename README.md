# Web Stopwatch

This project is a web-based stopwatch created during my internship at Prodigy Infotech. The stopwatch includes functionalities such as start, pause, reset, and lap. The project utilizes HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity.

## Features

- **Start:** Begin the stopwatch.
- **Pause:** Pause the stopwatch while preserving the current time.
- **Reset:** Reset the stopwatch to zero.
- **Lap:** Record the current time without stopping the stopwatch.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML:** Provides the basic structure of the stopwatch.
- **CSS:** Adds styling to the stopwatch, including layout and design.
- **JavaScript:** Adds interactivity, such as starting, pausing, resetting, and recording laps.
